# CS 6140 Course project

The structure of the code is as follows and everything is in CS 6140:

* conv1d contains the CNN experiment code and logs
* gru contains the GRU experiment code and logs
* lstm contains the vanilla LSTM experiment code and logs
* mini and ml contain the rest experiment code and logs

To reproduce the results and run the code, you might need to pull the original dataset from the [github repo](https://github.com/jethrosun/flux)
